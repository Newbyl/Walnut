            Checks if the expression stack S has enough expressions to match the arity of the Operator. If so, it unstacks one (named b) or two expressions (named b and a) depending on the arity of the operator.
            It then operates differently depending on the types of the unstacked expressions: 

            If the operator is "_" (unary minus) and b is of type:
            <ul>
                <li>Number Literal : Changes the literal to its opposite, add a "-" before its name and changes its value to the opposite and adds it to the expression Stack S </li>
                <li>Alphabet Letter : Changes the value of the letter to its opposite and adds it to the expression Stack S</li>
                <li>Word : It applies the operator on the automaton of the Word and adds it to the expression Stack S</li>
            </ul>
            If the operator's arity is 2 ( "+", "-", "*", "/" ), and a and b are of type :
            <ul>
                <li>Word and Word : Applies the operator using both automaton W of words and concatenates their M automaton and adds the indentifiers of b to the ones of a.Then adds a to S</li>
                <li>Word and (Alphabet Letter or Number Literal) : Applies the operator to the W automaton of Word and the constant. Adds the Word to the expression Stack S</li>
                <li>Both are (Alphabet Letter or Number Literal) : Adds to the stack of expression S a String which represents the formula : a operator b</li>
            </ul>
            If it is another combination, it creates a new expression which is a string representing "(a operator b)" with an automaton associated then adds it to the expression stack S.
