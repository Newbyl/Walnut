            Checks if the expression stack S has enough expressions to match the number of indices, then creates a temporary expression stack to
            store it.Creates an automaton M which will be used to have the final result and two lists of strings identifiers and quantifiers . Then it loops through the expressions in the temporary stack from the top to the bottom.
            For each expression, it operates differently depending on the type of the expression.
            <ul>
                <li>Variable : Adds the variable to the identifiers list, if the variable is already in, creates a new identifier for the variable.</li>
                <li>Arithmetic : Extracts the Automaton bound to the expression and concatenates it to the M automaton. The quantifiers and identifiers of the automaton from the expression are also added to the previous lists.</li>
                <li>Automaton : Concatenates the automaton to M. If it is possible, adds its identifiers to the previous lists, otherwise, it throws an Exception.</li>
                <li>Number Literal : Creates an automaton which accepts the value of the literal and concatenates it to M. Also adds the identifiers and quantifiers of the number literal to the previous lists.</li>
            </ul>
            At the end of the loop, it binds the extracted identifiers to W and it adds a new Expression to the stack S.
