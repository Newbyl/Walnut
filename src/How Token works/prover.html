        <h1>How the Prover class redirects to the appropriate methods ?</h1>
	
        <p>The Prover class is the first java class encountered when running a command in the Walnut terminal.
            The objective of this class is to read the input contained in the BufferReader and extract the free variables using Matcher on the pattern defined by the Walnut developers.
            When entering a def or eval command there are several important groups:
            static int ED_TYPE = 1, ED_NAME = 2, ED_FREE_VARIABLES = 3 ,ED_PREDICATE = 6, ED\_ENDING = 7;
            Here, the group at index 3 is used to extract the free variables from the command.
            It then calls the Computer class by passing it the predicate group (6).
            At the end of the different steps generated by Computer, Prover writes the automata, draws them (.gv), and fills the logs.</p>
