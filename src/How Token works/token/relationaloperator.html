        <h1>Act()</h1>
        <p>Various cases : </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a and b are both number or letter literals, the method constructs a new expression by concatenating them with the given operator and creates a finite automaton that matches the evaluation of the expression. This new expression is then stacked on the stack S.</li>
            <li>If a and b are a combination of word and arithmetic/variable, the method constructs a finite automaton that corresponds to the evaluation of the expression using the "comparison" method of "number_system" which returns a finite automaton representing the comparison of the two expressions according to the given operator. </li>
            <li>If a is a number or letter literal and b is of type arithmetic/variable, the method creates a finite automaton representing the comparison between the literal and the expression b, also using the finite automaton corresponding to the expression b.</li>
            <li>If a is of type arithmetic/variable and b is a number or letter literal, the method creates a finite automaton representing the comparison between the expression a and the literal, also using the finite automaton corresponding to the expression a.</li>
            <li>If a and b are both of type word, the method creates a finite automaton representing the comparison between the two words, also using the finite automata corresponding to the expressions a and b to build the final automaton.</li>
        </ul>
