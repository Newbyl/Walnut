        <p>The method performs a while loop as long as the operator stack is not empty. If the operator at the top of the stack is not a left parenthesis, it is removed from the stack and added to the postOrder list. 
            If the operator is a left parenthesis, it is removed from the stack and the method ends.
            If the stack is empty and there is no left parenthesis to match a right parenthesis, the method throws an exception reporting that the parentheses are not balanced at the position specified in the predicate.</p>
